# Development Commands

Use the provided Makefile for common development tasks:

- `make build` - Build for current platform
- `make build-all` - Build for multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- `make clean` - Clean build artifacts
- `make run` - Run the application directly with go run

The built binaries will be placed in the `bin/` directory.

# Code Formatting

Use `gofumpt` for Go code formatting, which is a stricter version of `gofmt`:

- Install: `go install mvdan.cc/gofumpt@latest`
- Format files: `gofumpt -w .`
- Check formatting: `gofumpt -d .`
